# üöÄ Projectile Motion Simulator üíª

A simple yet powerful Python application that simulates projectile motion with customizable parameters like velocity, angle, air resistance, gravity, and more!  Built using Pygame for interactive visuals and real-time updates.

## üìñ About the Project

This simulator allows you to visualize the trajectory of a projectile under various conditions. You can adjust parameters such as initial velocity, launch angle, mass, air resistance, gravity, radius of the projectile, and air density to observe how they affect the projectile's path. The simulator displays the trajectory in real-time and provides calculations for maximum height and horizontal distance traveled.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive UI:** Easily input and modify simulation parameters using intuitive input boxes.
* **Real-time Simulation:** Watch the projectile's path unfold dynamically as it's affected by various forces.
* **Customizable Parameters:** Control the projectile's initial conditions and environmental factors.
* **Visual Trajectory:** Observe the projectile's flight path with a clear and concise graphical representation.
* **Calculated Results:** Get instant feedback on the projectile's maximum height and horizontal distance.
* **Start, Pause, and Reset:**  Control the simulation flow with dedicated buttons.
* **Error Handling:** Prevents crashes with helpful messages, such as when mass is set to zero.

## üõ†Ô∏è How it Works

The simulation uses basic physics equations to calculate the projectile's position at each time step. The core components are:

* **UI (User Interface):**  Handles user input and displays parameters and controls.
* **Renderer:** Draws the projectile and its trajectory on the screen, and displays calculated results.
* **Physics Engine:**  Performs the calculations for projectile motion, taking into account gravity, air resistance, and other forces.


The simulation loop continuously updates the projectile's position based on these calculations and redraws the scene, creating the animation of the projectile's motion.
